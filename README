Annotated exceptions for Erlang.

This is a parse transform, which you invoke with

% erlc +'{parse_transform, smart_exceptions}' file.erl

(smart_exceptions.beam has to be in your path)

NOTES:
- the current version is getting a bit old (originally for R9C) and has some known bugs;
   should be renovated
- bug: throw(Term) mishandled in at least some cases
- exceptions when building binaries (wrong type etc) are not caught
- exceptions due to undefined calls are not caught

Furthermore, the code should be rewritten to always use 'try', and to always use
mapform0. The mapform calls are to a proprietary library, which is
nicer to use (for me) but basically unnecessary.
